        <p> <strong><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</strong></u></a> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.

        All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
        <p>javaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
